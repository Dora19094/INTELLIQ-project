# Instructions
Save project's folder in your PC locally.

Download NodeJs. You can follow the link : https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Set Google Chrome as default browser. You can do that by opening the browser, going to its settings and 
choosing the "default Browser" option.

In Chrome browser type : chrome://flags
Then search: invalid certificate, enable it and relaunch the browser.

Open the folder in VS Code(preferred) or the code editor you usually use.


# Database Setup
Download MongoDB Community Server. You can use the link : https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community. 
Download also MongoDB Compass. You can use the link : https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass.
Open the MongodB Compass and click on connect making sure the uri is : mongodb://localhost:27017.
To load data into the database you import into the collection blanks the file ./data/Final/blank.json and into the collection answers the file ./data/Final/answer.json. 

# Backend-API
Open the Window's Powershell terminal in VS Code and type `cd ./api-backend`.Then run the following command:
`npm install`. This will install the required packages for the project.To run the server you type :
`nodemon index`. If you installed it all correctly and the server is running you should see the following 
message in your terminal window : "Express app listening on port 3001 MongoDB database connection 
established successfully".

# Frontend 
Open a new Windows's Powershell terminal in VS Code(cntl+shift+5) and type `cd ./frontend` to go to the right 
folder.Then run the following command : `npm install` and when that is completed run the command : 

Windows(cmd.exe)
`set HTTPS=true&&npm start`

Windows(Powershell)
`($env:HTTPS = "true") -and (npm start)`

Linux, MacOS (Bash)
`HTTPS=true npm start`

If you installed it all correctly and the server is running, the Chrome page should appear.Enjoy!

# CLI 
Before using the cli the API needs to actiavted beforehand. In order to access the executable open a
terminal and `cd ./cli/dist/cli`, this opens the correct folder. Then you can use the cli by typing into
the same terminal commands like: `./se2215.exe  scope --param1 value1 [--param2 value2 ...] [--format fff --file fff]`. You can type `./se2215.exe` in order to see the help message, a list of all scopes and parameters.
