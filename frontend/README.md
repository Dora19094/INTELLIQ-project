# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Backend API library json-server

In order to simulate the backend, we used json-server library dependency. We use it with the following command:

```
json-server --watch .path_to_resource
```

We use it to fetch the data from the server in json format.

We added a second resourse to simulate the information based on the assignment's needs. The second resource contains the questions.
Due to having two resources, we added index.js. In index.js we declare the usage of two resources.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
